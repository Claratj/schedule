# Schedule

This project responds to a technical test of a few hours duration where two tasks were proposed to be accomplished:

## Functional tasks to be performed:

- As a user, I want to access the schedule of talks for a particular event. For each talk I want to display the following information:

✔️ Title
✔️ Name of the speaker
✔️ Schedule
✔️ Subject
✔️ Room where it will be given.
✔️ The list must be sorted by room and time.

- ✔️ As a user, I want to filter the list of lectures by speaker and subject. By default all the talks will be shown without filtering. Preferably the filters will be executed in the back part.

- ✔️ Extra: As a user I want to see the schedule painted in a table in which each row represents a time and each column a room. Note that the duration of the talks does not always have to be the same.

## Non-functional tasks to be performed:

- ✔️ Project dependencies must be managed with NPM.

- ✔️ The presentation and control layer will be built with React and TypeScript.

- The visual interface must be built without any CSS or component library and using APIs such as flexbox, grid and custom properties.

- ✔️ The existence of tests to ensure the correct functioning of the code.

- Extra:
  Have the application running in a Docker container.
  ✔️ Have the application deployed : https://events-schedule-fdewfe4z1-claratj.vercel.app/.

## Backlog

It would be great in the future to implement (not necessarily in this order):

- It would be interesting if the same way that you get the vocals of the events, you could get the number of rooms and create automatically the number of columns and rooms needed.

- Responsive design

- Improve accessibility

- Animations

-

- Add more test
